> This is a simple web application built with Express.js that allows users to upload an image and perform image recognition on it. 
The app uses a pre-trained MobileNet model from TensorFlow.js to recognize the image and return the most likely classification of the image.


## Built With

- Tensorflow
- Expressjs
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- EJS

### Features
